# YouTubeWrapped

This is a simple video automation project I took on over this past winter break. Having been recently inspired by the *2020 Wrapped* feature on Spotify, I decided to implement a similar feature for YouTube, another platform on which I spend large quantities of time.

Although this application is nowhere near as flashy as its audible counterpart, I had to jump over a few hurdles throughout the process that piqued my interest and made the project a fun challenge.

Example images of the output video are shown below.

As YouTube no longer provides access to a user's watch history through their latest API, I had to resort to other more creative yet cumbersome methods of obtaining this watch history in a reasonable manner. As a result, you will NOT be able to clone and run *main.py* as it is to achieve similar results. However, I am currently working on a video in which I elaborate on this process. It will be posted on YouTube and I'll have a link to it on this repo shortly.
