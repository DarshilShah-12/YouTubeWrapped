# Disclaimer

As YouTube no longer provides access to a user's watch history through their latest API (forum [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35172816)), I had to resort to other more creative but cumbersome methods of obtaining this watch history in a reasonable manner. As a result, you will NOT be able to clone and run *main.py* as it is to achieve similar results. However, I am currently working on a video in which I elaborate on this process. It will be posted on YouTube and I'll have a link to it on this repo shortly.

# Run It Yourself
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have all the Python packages list in *requirements.txt* installed. Otherwise, you can simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run *main.py*.

# YouTube Wrapped

This is a simple video automation project I took on over this past winter break. Having been recently inspired by the *2020 Wrapped* feature on Spotify, I decided to implement a similar feature for YouTube, another platform on which I spend large quantities of time.

Although this application is nowhere near as flashy as its audible counterpart, I had to jump over a few hurdles throughout the process that piqued my interest and made the project a fun challenge.

Sample frames from the output video are shown below.
