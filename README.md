# YouTubeWrapped

This is a simple video automation project I took on over this past winter break. Having been recently inspired by the *2020 Wrapped* feature on Spotify, I decided to implement a similar feature for YouTube, another platform on which I spend large quantities of time.

Although this application is nowhere near as flashy as its audible counterpart, I ran into a couple issues throughout the process that piqued my interest and made the project a fun challenge.

Example images of the output video are shown below.

As YouTube no longer provides access to a user's watch history through their latest API, I had to resort to other more creative yet cumbersome methods of obtaining this watch history in a reasonable manner. I will elaborate on this process in a video that I will link soon.
